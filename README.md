# Calculator

This was a really good app to kickstart my usage of swift in xcode. Making this app tought me a lot about H-Stacks, V-Stacks, and Z-Stacks. It also helped me figure out how to have a number / symbol appear in a spot, when a button with the identical number / symbol is clicked by a user.
